JPlay
by Nikolaj Baer

About:

JPlay is an attempt to build a 2D, physics based game engine for Android. This was partly an attempt to make a sellable android game, partly a fun trip into java land, and partly an interesting exploration into building a game engine. I think I did alot of things wrong.

JPlay has two build xml files, so it can be played both in Swing and in Android. I like to code in vim, so there aren't any eclipse project files around. JPlay was my test class name when i first started, but it stuck (and is probably heavily used by java tinkerers everywhere).

I was initialy inspired by the beautiful boiled down game D-Zone by Julian Cochran (http://www.digitalscores.com/dzone/), but the game took its own shape from there.

Please see license for precise license details, but I encourage any and all to fork, make a beautiful game or gain inspiration (or see how not to do things) via my code.
